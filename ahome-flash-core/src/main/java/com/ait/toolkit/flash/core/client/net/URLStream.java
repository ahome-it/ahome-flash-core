/**
 * The URLStream class provides low-level access to downloading URLs. Data is
 * made available to application code immediately as it is downloaded, instead
 * of waiting until the entire file is complete as with URLLoader. The URLStream
 * class also lets you close a stream before it finishes downloading. The
 * contents of the downloaded file are made available as raw binary data.
 * <p>
 * The read operations in URLStream are nonblocking. This means that you must
 * use the bytesAvailable property to determine whether sufficient data is
 * available before reading it. An EOFError exception is thrown if insufficient
 * data is available.
 * <p>
 * All binary data is encoded by default in big-endian format, with the most
 * significant byte first.
 * <p>
 * The security rules that apply to URL downloading with the URLStream class are
 * identical to the rules applied to URLLoader objects. Policy files may be
 * downloaded as needed. Local file security rules are enforced, and security
 * warnings are raised as needed.
